# ascii_crossy_road
Well, it started when I saw https://github.com/olegberman/ascii-flappy-bird by Oleg, and I was like "wait, why can't I create something similar?". I copied at least half of his code, and adapted another half to serve my higher purposes, and it worked! 30 lines, playable and kinda gives you an idea what is the original game.
